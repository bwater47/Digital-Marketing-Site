# Horiseon
Week 1 Challenge

## Description
You can click on the contents inside of the header, and it will take you to the menu that you chose. The header is located at the top of the website, and it is reactive to the cursor. You can see information about SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. There is also a benefits display on the right of the site for more information.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
You may use the website for gaining information on SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.

## Support
You can contact support through email by emailing brennw47@gmail.com.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
